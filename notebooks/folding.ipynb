    "# Outlook\n",
    "We have demonstrated that a molecular dynamics simulation can be carried out in the context of a subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We only have a single pdb_id right (1UBQ) now, but we can easily extend this to a list of pdb_ids. Lets establish a way to access all pdbs that are eligible for simulation. NOTE: we have the means to download the files from a database, given the pdb id, we just need a list of eligible pdb ids. This can be a static list which we have in a file, or we get it from a database too.\n",
    "- Use Gromacs python API, if it makes sense to do so (https://gromacs-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook/00_basic_example.html, https://github.com/Becksteinlab/GromacsWrapper). Making sense mens that we either have much cleaner code, or we can do something that we cannot do with the command line tool.\n",
    "- We need to actually fold some proteins and understand the expected results. Is this code stable? Does it produce the expected results? We need to understand the expected results and how to interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Validation Flow\n",
    "We need to understand how large this problem space is so that we do not exhaust all of the proteins too quickly and effectively kill the PoW component.\n",
    "Key points are:\n",
    "1. How many proteins are eligible for simulation?\n",
    "2. Is there a principled way to modify initial conditions to create new protchallallengeschengesein?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reward Mechanism\n",
    "We need to benchmark the reward mechanism in many ways before we can deploy this on mainnet. We need to understand the expected results in terms of miner rewards, competitiveness, dependency on hardware, etc. Main points are:\n",
    "1. How long does it take to fold a protein? How many simulations can a miner do in a day?\n",
    "2. How much does it cost to fold a protein? How much does it cost to run a simulation?\n",
    "3. How busy will validators be? How many simulations can a validator do in a day?\n",
    "4. What is the expected reward for a miner? How does this depend on the hardware?\n",
    "5. How does the reward depend on the protein? How does the reward depend on the simulation parameters?\n",
    " and also understand the expected results in terms of miner rewards, competitiveness, dependency on hardware, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remaining Steps\n",
    "- Run on testnet [DONE]\n",
    "- Run on mainnet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opportunities for Improvements\n",
    "- Improved customization of input files (e.g. force field, box, mdp templates)\n",
    "- Performance optimization (file usage, simulation length, parallelization)\n",
    "- Allow for different miners (e.g. AI models versus GPU models versus CPU models)\n",
    "- Perturbation of the structure (e.g. mutation) to prevent lookup attacks\n",
    "- More complex scoring function (e.g. based on RMSD)\n",
    "- More complex simulation (e.g. folding of a protein with multiple chains)\n",
